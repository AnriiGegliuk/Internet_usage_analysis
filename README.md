# Internet_usage_analysis

## Question: How has internet usage evolved over time across different countries?

The aim of this project is to analyze and visualize the evolution of internet usage across different countries over time using data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/internet). 
The dataset includes information on the percentage of individuals using the internet, number of internet users, and population for various countries from 1990 to 2020.

#### Key concepts:

Data cleaning and preparation: The dataset may contain missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies that need to be addressed before analysis. 
The data should be checked for completeness, accuracy, and consistency.

Data exploration and visualization: The data can be visualized using line charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps to identify trends, patterns, and relationships. 
The data can be grouped and filtered by country, region, income level, and other relevant variables.
Statistical analysis: The data can be analyzed using descriptive statistics, and time series analysis to estimate the growth rate, variability, and correlation of internet usage over time. 
The analysis can be used to identify countries that have experienced significant changes in internet usage and to compare the performance of countries across different periods.
Interpretation and communication: The results of the analysis are interpreted in the context of the main question and communicated effectively using data visualization tools. 
The findings should be used to answer the research question and to inform policy and decision-making.
