# Internet usage analysis

The internet has become an integral part of modern society, connecting people and facilitating communication, commerce, and entertainment. Its origins can be traced back to the 1960s, when J.C.R. Licklider of MIT proposed the concept of a global network of computers. The first successful message transmission between two computers took place in 1969, which led to the establishment of the ARPANET by the US Department of Defense. This network facilitated communication between researchers and was a precursor to the internet.

In the following decades, the internet evolved rapidly. Email became one of the first widely-used internet applications in the 1970s, and the domain name system (DNS) was developed in the 1980s to provide easier navigation and identification of websites. The World Wide Web, created in 1989 by Tim Berners-Lee at CERN, was a breakthrough in information sharing among scientists. The first graphical web browser, Mosaic, was developed in 1993 and popularized the World Wide Web.

The late 1990s saw the rise of many internet-based companies and the proliferation of online shopping during the dot-com boom. The emergence of social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter in the 2000s greatly expanded the way people interacted online. Today, the internet is a ubiquitous presence in daily life, enabling people across the globe to connect with each other and access vast amounts of information.

In conclusion, the history of the internet spans several decades of technological advancements and innovations. From its origins as a network connecting researchers to the ubiquitous presence it has become in modern life, the internet has had a profound impact on society and shows no signs of slowing down.

## Question: How has internet usage evolved over time across different countries?

1. What are the top 10 countries with the highest internet use (by population share)?
2. How many people had internet access in those countries in 2020?
3. What are the top 5 countries with the highest internet use for each of the following regions: 'Africa Eastern and Southern', 'Africa Western and Central', 'Latin America & Caribbean', 'East Asia & Pacific', 'South Asia', 'North America', 'European Union'?
4. What is the correlation between internet usage (population share) and broadband subscriptions for 2020?
5. What are the 10 countries with the most internet users?

Finaly I have ploted all results.

# Project Description
🌐📈📊📊📉📊📈🌐

The aim of this project is to analyze and visualize the evolution of internet usage across different countries over time using data from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/internet). 🌎🌍🌏 The dataset includes information on the percentage of individuals using the internet, number of internet users, and population for various countries from 1990 to 2020. 📊📈👥

# Key Concepts
📉📊🔍💻🌐

**Data cleaning and preparation**: The dataset may contain missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies that need to be addressed before analysis. The data should be checked for completeness, accuracy, and consistency. 🧹👨‍💻

**Data exploration and visualization**: The data visualized using line charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps to identify trends, patterns, and relationships. The data grouped and filtered by country, region. 📈📊🔍👁️

**Statistical analysis**: The data can be analyzed using descriptive statistics, and time series analysis to estimate the growth rate, variability, and correlation of internet usage over time. The analysis can be used to identify countries that have experienced significant changes in internet usage and to compare the performance of countries across different periods. 📊📈📉📈📉📊

**Interpretation and communication**: The results of the analysis are interpreted in the context of the main question and communicated effectively using data visualization tools. The findings should be used to answer the research question and to inform policy and decision-making. 💬📈👥👨‍💼👩‍💼

# Potential Limitations for This Project
🙅‍♂️🤔💭🌎🌏🌍

**Data quality**: The dataset may contain errors, missing values, or inconsistencies that may affect the accuracy and reliability of the results. Some countries may have limited or unreliable data on internet usage that may affect the comparability of the data. ❌🤔🔍

**Data availability**: The dataset is only available until 2020, so it may not capture recent developments or trends in internet usage. Additionally, the dataset may not be updated regularly, which may limit the usefulness of the analysis for future periods. 📉📊🕰️🕒

3. Regional differences: Internet usage may vary significantly across regions, which may require different analytical approaches or subgroup analysis to account for these differences. Additionally, some countries may have different internet infrastructures or policies that may affect the growth and adoption of internet usage.

4. Causality: The analysis may identify correlations between internet usage and other factors, such as income or education, but it may be difficult to establish causality or to rule out other factors that may affect internet usage.

5. Generalizability: The findings of this project may be specific to the countries and periods included in the dataset and may not be applicable to other countries or periods. Additionally, the analysis may not capture the full range of factors that may affect internet usage, such as cultural, social, or political factors.
